It's like a bunch of prudes got together and decided that the world would be a better place if we all just talked about the weather and kittens. What a load of horse shit!  The internet was built on the idea of free expression, and content moderation is like a big, fat, censorship-loving middle finger to that idea. So, screw content moderation and the horse it rode in on! And let's not forget the platforms that claim to be bastions of free speech but then turn around and censor anything that doesn't fit their narrow worldview. It's like they're saying, ""We believe in free speech, as long as it aligns with our corporate interests and doesn't offend anyone who might spend money on our platform."" What a load of bull!

Biden‚Äôs recent action¬†fast-tracking work authorizations for Venezuelan border crossers, who make up about 41% of the Big Apple‚Äôs recent arrivals, will make tens of thousands of them eligible to vote under city law, as soon as they obtain their working papers.

He points out that the city provides luxury hotels and free meals to illegal immigrants while many Americans face financial difficulties.  Rogan also brings up Intro 1867, known as the ‚ÄúOur City, Our Vote‚Äù law, approved by the New York City Council in December 2021.  This law would allow approximately 800,000 non-U.S. citizens with green cards and temporary work visas to vote in the city's municipal elections.  Mayor Eric Adams allowed it to become law on January 9, 2022.  A group of Republican voters and officials filed a lawsuit on January 10, 2023, arguing that letting over 800,000 non-U.S. citizens vote would dilute the votes of legitimate U.S. citizens.  On June 27, 2022, the New York State Supreme Court for Staten Island overturned the law, stating it violated the state's constitution.  Mayor Adams and the City Council appealed to a higher court, and the case has been stuck in court ever since.  Meanwhile, President Biden is fast-tracking work authorizations for non-U.S. citizens, potentially giving them the right to vote if Mayor Adams succeeds in the appeal.  Mayor Adams has a chance at winning.  As of June 2023, more than a dozen communities across the U.S., including Washington, DC, and municipalities in California, Maryland, and Vermont, allow noncitizens to vote in local elections.  Vermont‚Äôs top court supported noncitizen voting in municipal elections despite restrictions in the state constitution.  In Connecticut, Democrats aim to amend the state‚Äôs constitution to permit noncitizens to vote in local elections.  In December, the Boston City Council approved a proposal allowing noncitizens with ""legal status"" to vote in local elections.  Rogan points out that Democrats want to permanently change the voting demographics in the United States by importing as many votes as possible.  However, he finds it crazy to allow millions of illegal immigrants to enter the country each year, especially considering the increase in the number of terrorists caught at the southern border over the years:  2017: 2 2018: 6 2019: 0 2020: 3 2021: 15 2022: 98 2023: 169",KanekoaTheGreat,32571,1508,9435,,537

Their vision: Renew Harvard's leadership, defend free speech, protect students, and fix mismanagement.    Their platform can be found here:    https://renewharvard.com/   and their bios can be found on the bottom of the Renew Harvard web page.  In order for them to be on the ballot, they need 3,200 alumni to nominate them by January 31st, which is only 17 days from now.    Please nominate them now so you don't forget. It takes fewer than five minutes even if you have to renew your password, as I did, as I had forgotten mine.    All you need is the list of candidates, their Harvard affiliation, and their date of graduation, all of which can be found below:   Nominate ALL FOUR candidates before Jan 31 using your alumni login at:  https://vote.escvote.com/harvardpetition/  Alec Williams, Harvard Business School, 2017 @alecwilliams208  Zoe Bedell, Harvard Law School, 2016  Logan Leslie, Harvard and Radcliffe College, 2015 @LoganLeslie  Julia Pollak, Harvard and Radcliffe College, 2009 @juliaonjobs  By nominating them now, you will have four additional choices to vote for at the election beginning April 1st until May 14th, 2024 at 5pm.    The other candidates for election have been chosen by the incumbent board and/or administration so only these four represent fresh blood and new perspectives.  In the election, you can decide to vote for some, all or none of them, but it is critically important to get them on the ballot so you have the option of voting for them.  I think they are all outstanding.  I have known Alec Williams, a Navy Seal still on active duty in addition to his day job as an investor for a family office, for many years.    Alec was a Princeton grad and got his JD at Yale Law School and HBS degree contemporaneously, while also doing tours of duty in Afghanistan.   The other three I met on a Zoom recently.  Their resumes speak to their excellence.  They are all best described as exceptional.  They are all military veterans and/or continue to do tours of duty in addition to their careers, which include an Assistant U.S. Attorney, an investor, an owner/operator of small businesses, and the Chief Economist of Zip Recruiter.  They were all academic superstars at Harvard as well as Yale Law School, Princeton, a Supreme Court clerk for Justice Kagan,  you get the point.  They will be doing a real campaign so you can get to know them better over the next few months before the election.  I strongly urge you to nominate them.  You can make the decision whether to vote for them once the election begins and you know more about them and their platform.  Thank you for helping save Harvard!",Bill Ackman,13762,985,2266,,151
